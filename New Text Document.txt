i am a first year student at Saxion university in Deventer, Netherlands studying Software engineering. I have experience good experience in java and python along with Linux. I am interested in this internship is i think it can be a great way to improve myself and i know it will be a challenge which is why i am very interested as if this internship was easy i would not be able to develop and i am the type that never gives up until i achieve my goals because i tend to find it satisfying when i end the day being able to do something new that i preciously either did not know existed or had no clue how to go about performing it. i hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Omar Zaarour El Keddeh.
